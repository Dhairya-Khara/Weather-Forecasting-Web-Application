# Weather Forecasting Web Application
The application can be viewed [here](https://khara-weather-website.herokuapp.com/). The goal of this project was learning how to make a web application with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
in the backend. Furthermore, learning how to use REST APIs was also crucial to complete this web app. Currently, this application uses raw html, css and javascript in its frotend
while [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) ([w/ express](https://expressjs.com/)) in its backend. This application also uses REST APIs from [maxbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)
and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). Here is a diagram that describes the architecture of the application:

## Current Status
This project is currently in development. I created this website in early 2019 and have learnt a lot since then. The frontend is going to be completely redesigned using 
[React](https://reactjs.org/) to create a more interactive user interface. Moreover, the responsiveness of this application is quite poor and the user interface on mobile 
devices is horrible. Thus, there is currently a seperate client directory with boilerplate code.
