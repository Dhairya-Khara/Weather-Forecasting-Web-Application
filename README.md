# Weather Forecasting Web Application
The application can be viewed [here](https://khara-weather-website.herokuapp.com/). The primary goal of this project was learning how to make a web application with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
in the backend. Furthermore, learning how to use REST APIs was also crucial to complete this web app. Currently, this application uses raw html, css and javascript in its frotend
while [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) ([w/ express](https://expressjs.com/)) in its backend. This application also uses REST APIs from [maxbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)
and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). Furthermore, the front-end is developed using [React] (https://reactjs.org/) ([w/ Redux](https://redux.js.org/)). Here is a diagram that describes the architecture of the application:
