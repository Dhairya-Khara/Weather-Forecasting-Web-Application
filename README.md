# Weather Forecasting Web Application
The application can be viewed [here](https://khara-weather-website.herokuapp.com/). The primary goal of this project was learning how to make a web application with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) in the backend. Furthermore, learning how to use REST APIs was also crucial to complete this web app. This application uses REST APIs from [maxbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)
and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). The front-end is developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([w/ Redux](https://redux.js.org/)). Here is a diagram that describes the architecture of the application:

## IMPORTANT
This repository is the production build. Hence, it is not recommended to try and run this application from source. This repository is missing some esssential components
required for the application to run. For example environment variables such as API keys for Mapbox and OpenWeather. These env variables are stored on a local dev.env file and for
obvious reasons, this file has not been comitted to this public github repo.
